# CapstoneCode
Thermal Camera code + CNN_training code + CNN validation code
note: topdown_Showcase_Latest_best_checkpoint_Emptyroom.model is the current latest trained model.
By default for running the code , Run AutomateModel.ipynb to execute cnn_validation.ipynb model every 5mins. 

If new data has been collected, run cnn_train to train a new model to load into cnn_validation.ipynb
